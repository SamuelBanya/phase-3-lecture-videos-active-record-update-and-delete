Here are the commands I used to code along with the assignment:
#+begin_src ruby
Author.update(bio: "is a cat")
Author.second.update(bio: "Award winning biographer writer")

# NOTE: This was attempted with the 'pry' breakpoint, but didn't result in an actual change:
Author.third[:bio] = "Professor at University of Washington"

# If we instead use a variable, we can make an actual change
a3 = Author.third
a3[:bio] = "Professor at University of Washington"
a3.save()
#+end_src

She then used the following commands to 'delete' instances:
#+begin_src ruby
Author.last.destroy()
Author.destroy_all()
#+end_src
